    <string name="corporate_wellness_details">Are you a business/institution looking to bring some health and wellness into your team?

\n \nA healthy lifestyle, including fitness, proper nutrition, and a healthy work-life balance, is essential for an individual to perform well in any area of life. However, with the hectic pace of life today, it is easy to forget to take care of oneself. Overwhelming stress, a sedentary routine, and poor lifestyle choices restrain optimum performance at work. Employees are availing their sick leaves more than ever, and productivity is going down. If left unchecked, not only is the health of the employees at stake, but also the health of the company.

\n \nWe at healthhunt have the perfect tool to help you get started. Contact us at <a href = "info@healthhunt.in">info@healthhunt.in</a> for more details.</string>


    <string name="schools_and_colleges">Schools and colleges</string>
    <string name="schools_and_colleges_details">We at healthhunt believe that the health and wellness revolution should begin right from childhood. If good habits are inculcated from the start, our children will grow up to be healthy adults. Our aim is to make healthy living a part of everyone’s lifestyle, both of parents as well as of students. In today’s fast-paced world, stress is a major contributor to being unhealthy and diseased. Apart from that, poor eating habits, the lack of time and motivation to exercise, and emotional issues are wreaking havoc. Even young children are not spared from these toxic problems. This is the reason that we are inviting schools and colleges to join our #healthrevolution.

\n \nIt’s as easy as 1-2-3 to be a part of this beautiful and essential change. Once you register with us, you can choose your categories, and we will provide to you content pertaining to the same. This content can be provided to the parents of the children studying in your school via your website, handouts, or any other way of dissemination that you see fit.

    <string name="our_story">Our story</string>
    <string name="our_story_details">Healthhunt aims to #disrupt the understanding of daily wellbeing across Asia. 25% of Indians may die at the age of 70, on account of an unhealthy lifestyle. Daily wellbeing, mindfulness, and self care should begin at a very early age in life, and not when diseases and lifestyle issues kick in. healthhunt is Asia\'s first fully integrated mind-body wellness platform. Being a content-led marketplace with a wide listing of health and wellness experts, as well as service providers, makes us a one stop shop.
We are fully committed to generating awareness through short-formatted and actionable content, which is very easy to apply to your day-to-day life. Taking into account each person’s holistic needs, we are committed to aiding you organically through this process.

We believe that the human body is most perfectly designed by nature. If well maintained, it is capable of miraculous expressions. Therefore, a healthy, disease-free life is your natural right. The key is to provide yourself with just a little care, by making conscious lifestyle choices daily.

We encourage you to join our wellness revolution, and carry yourselves and your loved ones into uncompromising health.
Because, ultimately…It’s your body. It matters. </string>
